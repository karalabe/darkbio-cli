# Output

stdout carries only the result. stderr carries everything read along the
way: progress, notes, warnings, approvals, hints, steps, logs and errors.
Keep the two apart when parsing.

## Reading output

The default output is formatted for reading, the same on a terminal and in a
pipe. One item prints as a block of labels and values, several as a table.
Sizes carry their unit in the value, and a size column shares one unit, so
sizes compare down the column. Absent values print as -, empty lists as
none and booleans as yes and no. Timestamps are in local time. A mark before
a state is decoration, and the word beside it is the value. The view may
shorten, round or leave out long fields, while --json always has the whole
value. Colors and live progress need a terminal, and NO_COLOR or CLICOLOR=0
turns colors off.

## JSON

--json prints one result document on stdout, indented by two spaces, and
one JSON event per line on stderr. Keys are snake_case. Absent values are
null, enums are strings, times are ISO 8601 in UTC, byte counts end in
_bytes and durations in _seconds. Task ids and the Ark's error numbers are
decimal strings, so they stay exact. New fields may appear,
and a renamed field means a new major version, so scripts pin the version
`ark --version --json` prints. Help and completions print text even with
--json.

Every stderr line under --json is one event, however long its message:

    {"event":"approve","message":"unlock (Ark Companion on your phone)"}

The kinds are progress, note, warning, approve, hint, step, log and error.
A log event also carries level, target and fields, and an error event the
error object. A caller that merged the two streams drops the lines starting
with `{"event":` and keeps the document. Progress messages are worded for
reading, so they are not a structured progress feed.

## Events and verbosity

On a terminal, progress redraws in place once a second. Redirected, it
prints a line at every ten percent or every 5 s. -q hides progress, notes,
warnings and steps, and keeps errors, hints, approvals, logs and app output.
-v adds steps. --log debug adds the diagnostics of ark's release lookup and
its connection library, and --log trace adds the wire protocol too. Logs
never carry credentials or authorization headers.

## App output

Without --json, `ark app run` writes the released report to stdout exactly
as the app printed it. The app's stderr, which only a develop build
releases, follows on stderr after a note giving its size. With --json both
streams are fields of the document, stdout and stderr when they are UTF-8,
stdout_base64 and stderr_base64 otherwise. Either way, app output arrives
only once the owner releases it.

## Failures

A failure prints error[code]: message on stderr, then hint: lines naming the
next step where ark knows one. Under --json the error event carries the
error object. It holds code and message, and for a refusal by the Ark also
remote, with the Ark's own code and message.

A command that did part of its work keeps that result on stdout, reports
the failure on stderr and exits non-zero. A command with no result prints
nothing on stdout, or under --json a document holding only the error:

    {"error": {"code": "no-device", "message": "no Ark enclave found"}}

## New releases

At most once an hour, ark asks GitHub for its newest release. A release
build reads the redirect at https://github.com/dark-bio/cli/releases/latest,
and a development build reads the release list from api.github.com. The
request carries nothing about this computer, its Arks or the running
version. It runs in a detached copy of ark that exits within 30 s, so no
command waits for it. The answer is kept in update.json in ark's cache
directory, and a nonempty CI turns the lookup off.

While the kept answer names a newer version, every command except help,
completions, --version and doctor starts with a note naming both versions
and how to upgrade. Under --json it is an ordinary note event. The note
never changes the result or the exit code, and -q hides it. doctor looks up
afresh and reports the answer as its update check.

## Error codes

Each code is stable and belongs to one exit class.

Exit 1 is a problem with a local input or a missing confirmation.

- `file-not-found`, `file-unreadable` and `file-empty` mean the named file
  cannot be used. Check the path.
- `file-rejected` means the Ark or ark refused the file's content, and the
  message says why.
- `invalid-slot` means the Ark identified another slot than --slot names, or
  has no such slot. `ark data list` shows the slots.
- `invalid-key` means --pubkey is not a valid public key.
- `invalid-version` means the --version build is not published for this
  environment. `ark firmware list` shows what is.
- `confirmation-required` means installing firmware needs confirmation. Add
  --yes to `ark firmware update`.
- `enrollment-required` means the Ark is enrolled in a browser at Ark Hub,
  at the address the hint gives.
- `io` means a local read or write failed.

Exit 2 is `usage`, for invalid arguments or an unknown help topic. A slot of
0 or below is a usage error, and a positive one the Ark lacks is
invalid-slot.

Exit 3 is a problem reaching the Ark.

- `no-device` means no Ark is attached, or none matches --device. Run
  `ark devices`.
- `ambiguous-device` means several Arks match. Pick one with --device from
  the locators the hint lists.
- `device-busy` means another ark command or an Ark Hub browser tab holds
  the Ark. Wait for the command to finish, or close the tab.
- `device-unreachable` and `disconnected` mean the connection failed or
  dropped. On Linux, a permission error's hint gives the udev rule.
- `handshake-failed` means the Ark's attestation or identity did not verify.

Exit 4 is a problem with the cloud.

- `cloud-unreachable` means a request to the cloud, the package host or the
  relay failed.
- `approval-undelivered` means the approval never reached the phone. The
  warning before it names the cause, and `ark doctor` checks the relay.
- `environment-unknown` means no cloud environment is known. Select one with
  --env.
- `login-required` means a develop or staging host wants a browser login.
  The hint gives the cloudflared command to run.
- `proof-rejected` means the cloud refused the Ark's proof. Run
  `ark doctor`. A firmware update refreshes the keys first, so run it again.
- `pairing-failed` means the pairing exchange failed in the cloud or on the
  phone. Run `ark pair` again.
- `registry-inactive` means the Ark's registration is disabled, expired or
  superseded. A disabled Ark needs Dark Bio. An expired or superseded
  emulator becomes a fresh device through `ark-emulator stop`, `wipe` and
  `start`, and is then enrolled again.

Exit 5 is the Ark's state or its refusal.

- `not-paired` means no phone is paired with the Ark yet. Run `ark pair`.
- `locked` means the Ark needs unlocking. Run `ark unlock`, or add --unlock.
  A dry run needs `ark unlock` first.
- `already-paired` and `already-enrolled` mean the Ark is in that state
  already.
- `firmware-outdated` means the firmware is older than this tool supports.
  Run `ark firmware update`, or install a newer Ark Emulator for an
  emulator.
- `update-unverified` means the Ark came back from a firmware update running
  another build than the one installed.
- `dependency-missing` means a reference slot requires a slot that is empty,
  such as the owner's calls. Fill that one first.
- `no-download` means the Ark offers no download for the slot
  `ark data fetch` names.
- `ark` means the Ark refused the request. Act on its message, never on its
  number, which can change between firmware builds.
- `unsupported` means the Ark never serves the request in its build or role,
  such as a firmware update on an emulator.
- `unavailable` means the Ark serves the request, but not in its current
  state, such as before a cloud sync.
- `unknown` means the Ark does not know the request, so the firmware and ark
  are out of step. Update both.
- `unanswered` means the Ark dropped the request without an answer.

Exit 6 is an approval that did not come.

- `approval-denied` means the owner declined the request or an app's
  report, or Ark Companion sent an answer the Ark could not accept.
- `approval-timeout` means nobody answered within the window. For pairing,
  run `ark pair` again.

Exit 7 is `timeout`, for a wait on a machine that ran past --timeout or past
a fixed limit, such as the 5 s handshake that opens a connection or the
120 s an Ark gets to return from a firmware update.

Exit 8 is `app-failed`, for an app that failed when the owner released its
result. The document still holds what the Ark returned.

Exit 130 is `interrupted` and exit 143 `terminated`, for Ctrl-C and SIGTERM.
ark asks the Ark to cancel the active task or upload before it exits, and
under --json the document holds the last partial result. An upload the Ark
is already processing keeps going.
